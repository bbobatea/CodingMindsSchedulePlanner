This app uses Flutter, Dart language and Firebase's realtime data base and authentication system. It is a simple app to help user make a schedule plan with a added time, title, and description which they are able to view in the home page. All user data is saved to a database and user can make multiple accounts with a valid email. The user cannot make a account with a invalid email address since firebase will authenticate it first before the app creates the new account and adding it to the database.

This was created for coding minds flutter mobile development bootstrap
